# Black_Friday_AV
This a regression problem where we need to predict the purchase made by a user.
We have data for some users regarding the purchases they made on a black friday sale.
The original dataset has 12 features and 550068 rows.
I have implemented regression using various models, out of which I got the best solution using Random Forest regressor.
EDA, feature engineering, missing value impuduation, encoding of categorical variables, model training and hyper parameter tuning has been done.
